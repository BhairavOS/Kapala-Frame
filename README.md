## About The Project

KapalaFrame — the core framework that powers Bhairav OS. It’s a modern, batteries-included C++ framework designed to make your development process smoother and more efficient. We’ve created KapalaFrame to give you a solid foundation for building cross-platform applications and libraries without the usual complexities. With KapalaFrame, you can focus more on your ideas and less on the technical details. Whether you’re developing for desktop, mobile, or embedded systems, KapalaFrame ensures your project is built on a reliable, scalable foundation, making C++ development a joy instead of a challenge.
